Lowtime is probably one of the most basic Alarm Clock applications on the market.  To setup simply click "Set Lowtime".

Alarm Time : The same as other Alarm clock apps, the time to alert.
Range : Number of minutes from the Alarm time in which you want to notified.  
Wake Tone : The tone that you want to play during the Alarm or if the time is within the range.
Snooze Duration : Number of minutes ahead to reset the Alarm and Range to.

Example : You want to get out of bed anytime between 5:30am and 6:00am.  Set the Alarm time for 6:00am and range for 15 minutes.  

Once activated, a shake of the phone will either launch the wake up tone or show a dark screen notifying you that its safe to go back to sleep.  

* Note * 
This is the initial release of the app.  Feel free to send an email if you run into an issue.
